# C# Music Player App

Welcome to my Simple Music Player App! I've taken a dive into the world of music and programming by creating this app using Microsoft Visual Studio and the C# programming language. While it might not have all the bells and whistles of professional music players, it's a fun little project that lets you play around with your favorite tunes.
